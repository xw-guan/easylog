# EasyLog

EasyLog is a simple leveled logger for Go. The goal of this project is to provide an easily-used logging tool for small Go applications.

EasyLog is an incompletely tested toy so far. I am going to do some tests and benchmarks to verify if it actually works.

## Usage

See [examples](https://github.com/xw-guan/easylog/tree/master/example)
